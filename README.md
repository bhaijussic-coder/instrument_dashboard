# Instrument Dashboard (React)

Local dev (install deps then run):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This project is scaffolded with Vite + React. It includes a simple Context store in `src/store/contextStore.js` to hold instruments and test results. The `Dashboard` component uses `chart.js` to render a doughnut chart from store data.

Use the "Add demo result" button in the Dashboard to feed sample results into the store.
